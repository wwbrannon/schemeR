schemeR
=======

Ports of certain features found in traditional Scheme dialects to R (which is itself descended from Scheme), insofar as this is possible without modifying R itself. In particular, provide tools to build Lisp-style macros in R.

Installation:
-------------

There's no CRAN version yet, so install the dev version from github:

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("wwbrannon/schemeR")
