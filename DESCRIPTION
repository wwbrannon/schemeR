Title: Ports of Lisp/Scheme Features to R
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Description: Provides a Lisp-like mini-language within R, with a prefix syntax
    and versions of many of the usual Lisp operators (let, cond, do, functional
    programming utilities, etc.). Code written with this package is still valid
    R, but the differences from what R code normally looks like highlight the
    language's roots in Scheme. Common Lisp-style macros, based on defmacro,
    are also supported, with an implementation much closer to Lisp's behavior
    than other macro implementations for R.
