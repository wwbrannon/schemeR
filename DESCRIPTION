Title: Ports of Lisp/Scheme Features to R
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Description: Provides a way to write R code in a Lisp-like prefix form, with
    access to versions of many common Lisp operators (let, letrec, cond, do,
    etc.). True Lisp macros (defmacro-based, rather than syntax-case) are
    also supported and are optimized to work with this sort of prefix code.
